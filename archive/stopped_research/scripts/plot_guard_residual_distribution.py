"""Plot outage proxy vs guard margin (operating curve) for Stage 4.

NOTE ON SCOPE: per-sample residual errors are NOT exported in the repository
(they require the trained checkpoint, which lives on the training machine), so
this figure is NOT a per-sample residual histogram. It plots the *measured
operating points* of the alpha sweep --- outage proxy as a function of the
guard margin in metres --- which is fully backed by:
  docs/risk_aware_control_stage4_results.txt
Vertical markers: deterministic guard (alpha=0) = 9.56 m, and the
uncertainty-aware best-reward guard (alpha=0.25) = 10.88 m.
